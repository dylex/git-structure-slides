      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git\n",
      "       directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and\n",
      "       template files. An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the\n",
      "       master branch is also created.\n",
      "\n",
      "       If the $GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to\n",
      "       use instead of ./.git for the base of the repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "       If the object storage directory is specified via the\n",
      "       $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY environment variable then the sha1 directories\n",
      "       are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects\n",
      "       directory is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Running git init in an existing repository is safe. It will not\n",
      "       overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for\n",
      "       rerunning git init is to pick up newly added templates (or to move the\n",
      "       repository to another place if --separate-git-dir is given).\n",
      "\n",
      "OPTIONS\n",
      "       -q, --quiet\n",
