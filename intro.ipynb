      "\n",
      "       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. If\n",
      "       you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple\n",
      "       lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given. Only the existing\n",
      "       values that match the regexp are updated or unset. If you want to\n",
      "       handle the lines that do not match the regex, just prepend a single\n",
      "       exclamation mark in front (see also the section called “EXAMPLES”).\n",

      "       The type specifier can be either --int or --bool, to make git config\n",
      "       ensure that the variable(s) are of the given type and convert the value\n",
      "       to the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a \"true\" or\n",
      "       \"false\" string for bool), or --path, which does some path expansion\n",
      "       (see --path below). If no type specifier is passed, no checks or\n",
      "       transformations are performed on the value.\n",
      "\n",
